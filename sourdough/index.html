        <h2>Feeding the starter</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/starter.jpg">
          <figcaption>Fed starter at its most active</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Two days before you want to bake bread, feed your starter.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5g starter</li>
          <li>50g warm water (~85&deg;F)</li>
          <li>50g rye flour</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just mix together the ingredients above. I place it in a cooler with a warm quart of water to help it stay warm overnight. Do this right before going to bed; that way, it will be ready to use for the preferment in the morning. The starter is ready to use when it's at double its initial heightt; use a rubberband to mark its initial height.</p>
        <p>My starter is in a 16oz mason jar. I never wash it between feedings. When I want to feed my starter, I just take out the excess and leave 5g in the jar. Then, I add the water and flour. I am careful to keep the sides clean when I make my starter by using a silicone spatula to push the starter down to the bottom of the jar.</p>
        <p>When I'm not using my starter, it's in the fridge. It's only fed once, which is before I need it for the preferment.</p>

        <h2>Making the preferment</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/preferment.jpg">
          <figcaption>Just after making the preferment, and at its most active</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>What's a preferment? Great question. My understanding is that it's a small bit of dough that ferments before the rest of the dough is made, and it makes your bread taste even better. King Arthur Flour has a more detailed explanation <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/pro/reference/preferment" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>20g active starter</li>
          <li>90g whole wheat flour</li>
          <li>90g warm water (~85&deg;F)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The morning after the starter is fed, make the preferment. The started should be double its initial height, but it's fine if it's collapsed a bit.</p>
        <p>Mix the ingredients in a clean 24oz container; I use a plastic deli container. I place it in a coller with a warm quart of water to help it stay warm. Just like the starter, the preferment is ready to use when it's at double its initial height; use a rubberband to mark its initial height.</p>

        <h2>Autolyse</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/autolyse.jpg">
          <figcaption>Just after mixing preferment, flour, and water; and just after almost an hour of autolyse, with salt, water, and cheddar added</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Another sourdough term worth knowing: Autolyse. It's a process in which the flour and water are mixed before other ingredients are added, which allows the four to become hydrated and encourages gluten development. As usual, KAF offers a nice explanation <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2017/09/29/using-the-autolyse-method" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>200g active preferment</li>
          <li>500g whole wheat flour</li>
          <li>500g bread flour</li>
          <ul>
            <li>OR 480g all-purpose flour and 20g vital wheat gluten</li>
          </ul>
          <li>800g warm water (~85&deg;F)</li>
          <li>20g salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Mix everything except the salt and 100g of the water in a large, clear container, and make sure there's no dry flour anywhere. I use a 4-quart Pyrex mixing bowl. Loosely cover with a towel. Try to keep your dough  around 80&deg;F.</p>

        <p>I let my dough autolyse for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes; it really just depends on my schedule.</p>

        <p>When the dough is hydrated, mix in the salt and remaining 100g of water. If you'd like to add anything else like seeds, herbs, olives, cheese, now's the time to do it. Let sit for 30 minutes.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Bulk fermentation</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/bulk-fermentation.jpg">
          <figcaption>Two hours after dough is mixed at the end of autolyse, two hours later, and end of four-hour bulk fermentation</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>This is your dough's first rise. It's the most important part of the sourdough process, and the most important ingredient is time. Don't rush this section! This is when your dough ferments and developes acids and gasses that give your dough flavor and strength and volume. Read more about it from KAF <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2019/07/22/bread-dough-bulk-fermentation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>This period is really just stretching and folding your dough every 30-45 minutes for 3-4 hours. The range of time here is really dependent on the strength of your starter/preferment and the temperature of your dough/location. The weaker your starter/preferment, or the colder your dough/location, the longer bulk fermentation will take.</p>

        <p>To stretch and fold: Use the bowl scraper in one hand to loosen the dough from the side of the bowl, and grab the dough with your other hand. Stretch it upward and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl as you stretch and fold. You will notice that over time, the dough will become easier to handle: soft, smooth, and a fluffy, kind of matte. Toward the end of fermentation, you can see bubbles along the side of the bowl.</p>

        <p>Notice the difference in the dough between the first and second folds in the videos below.</p>

        <!-- stretch and fold #1 -->
        <div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzAQK3J5cRE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <!-- stretch and fold #2 -->

        </div>

        <p>I find that stretching and folding the dough with my hands is easier after quickly running my hands through water and lightly drying them. Also, no part of my skin touches the dough for more than one second at a time. The dough sticks less to my hands this way.</p>

        <h2>Shaping the dough</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/shaped.jpg">
          <figcaption>Mass of dough laid out and ready to be shaped, shaped and in the basket, ready for its final rise</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Your dough is ready to be shaped when it's nice and billowy, about 150% its initial volume.</p>

        <p>Over a clean surface, flip the bowl of dough over and use the scraper to help scoop it out as one mass. Dust the top of the dough. With a bench knife, divide the dough into two equal portions.</p>

        <p>Preshape: Use the bench knife or just your hands to shape the each portion into tight balls. It helps if you touch the dough as little as possible, and a bench knife helps with this, as the dough sticks less on a knife than on your hands. I'll admit that I'm still learning thow to do this properly... In the video above, the second piece is shaped better than the first one. With the first one, the sticky bottom is exposed during shaping; I wasn't able to keep the smooth, non-sticky side of the dough facing upward. This step just takes a lot of careful practice, but it's fun.</p>

        <!-- divide and shape -->
        <div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHUv6PY6HB4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>Here are some resources on preshaping:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2019/02/08/preshaping-bread-dough" target="_blank">Blog post from King Arthur Flour</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEG1BjWroT0" target="_blank">Demo video from San Francisco Baking Institute</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/U4dyWZZVeWI?t=622" target="_blank">Fast shaping from Tartine Bakery</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bench rest: After preshaping, let the dough rest for five minutes before final shaping.</p>

        <p>Final shaping: On a lightly floured surface (or dust the top of your dough), flip the dough over so that its bottom is on top. Use paddle hands to stretch out the dough so it's kind of square. Degas the dough by squeezing any large bubbles. On one side of the dough, fold it over the center of the dough, and repeat this step on the opposite side; this should be like folding a letter into thirds for an envelope. Your dough should be rectangular in shape now. Take one short end and roll it toward the other end, like a yoga mat. Where the dough seams together, pinch (or braid) the seam together. Use the rice/whole wheat blend to dust the inside of the basket, and then put your dough in there, seam side up.</p>

        <!-- final shape, boule #1 -->
        <div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/10PXqtvVvIA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <!-- final shape, boule #2 -->
        <div class="mb-3 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
          <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5itzlDvxws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>It's important to make sure the seam holds so that the tension of the dough is maintained; otherwise, you'll get a flat loaf. If you don't think your seam is strong, let the dough rest on its seam for a few minutes before putting it in the basket.</p>

        <p>Place parchment paper over the top of each basket of dough. Then, put each basket in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 10-20 hours.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to reduce the amount of flour I use for dusting when working with the dough. I'll dust the dough if I need that side of the dough to not be sticky (e.g to keep the gluten structure on one side during preshaping or to keep the dough from sticking to the basket during the final rise). When I work with dough, I avoid the dough's stickiness by having damp hands and short touches and a bench knife. Using too much flour for dusting leads to too much flour in the air, which can lead to baker's asthma.</p>

        <h2>Baking the bread</h2>

        <div class="image ml-4 mb-3">
          <img src="../img/sourdough/baked.jpg">
          <figcaption>Scored and before baking; after 20 minutes baking time, now uncovered; after 55 total minutes baking time</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Put the Dutch oven in the oven and set the oven to 475&deg;F. If you don't have a Dutch oven, a baking stone with a roasting pan on the rack below it should be fine.</p>
        <p>15 minutes after the oven is ready, remove the dough from the oven. Put the parchment paper on a pizza peel or some other flat surface on which you can transfer the dough. Flip the dough out of the basket and onto the parchment. Using a lame or razor, score the bread, with the cut at least a half inch deep.</p>
        <p>Transfer the dough into the Dutch oven, and let it bake covered for 20 minutes. If you have a Dutch oven combo cooker, put the dough in the shallow pan. If you don't have a Dutch oven, add maybe two cups of water to the roasting pan.</p>
        <p>After 20 minutes, remove the cover, and let it bake for 30-35 more minutes. If you have Dutch combo cooker oven, nest the pans so that the shallow pan is sitting in the deeper pan. This will get you a really dark loaf. I actually like this caramelized crust, but some people don't like it. If you prefer something lighter, when you remove the lid after the first 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 450&deg;F.</p>
        <p>And now, the hardest part: Allow to cool completely (at least 1-2 hours) on a rack before cutting and eating. Your bread is still baking as it cools! If you cut it too soon, the bread will stick to your knife.</p>
